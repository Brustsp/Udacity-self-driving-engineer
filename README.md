# Udacity self driving car engineer
The Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program is one of the only programs in the world to both teach students how to become a self-driving car engineer, and support students in obtaining a job within the field of autonomous systems. The programâ€™s nine projects equip students with invaluable skills across a wide array of critical topics, including deep learning, computer vision, sensor fusion, localization, planning, controllers, vehicle kinematics, automotive hardware, and more. As part of their capstone project, students have the opportunity to run their code on a virtual simulation of Udacity's real self-driving car, Carla.

From a few above mentioned projects, specific projects were chosen on which I focus, as following shows:

1. perception
    - Find lane lines & advanced
    - Traffic sign classifier
    - Vehicle detection
2. path planning
3. path tracking
    - PID
    - MPC
